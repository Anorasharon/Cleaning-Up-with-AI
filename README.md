# Cleaning-Up-with-AI
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based image classification model that can automatically classify different types of garbage into five categories: cardboard, metal, paper, plastic, and white-glass. The goal is to support automated waste segregation, which is crucial for sustainable waste management and recycling processes.
